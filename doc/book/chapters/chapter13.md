## VERIFICATION PROCESS

The verification process provides assurance that the hardware item implementation meets the requirements. Verification consists of reviews, analyses and tests applied as defined in the verification plan. The verification process should include an assessment of the results.

Note 1: Safety aspects of hardware design take the form of safety requirements to be met by the hardware implementation.

This section provides guidance for the verification process that should be applied to the hardware design. The verification process may be applied at any level of the design hierarchy as defined in the hardware verification plan. For safety requirements, it is advantageous to apply the verification process at various stages of the design process to increase the probability, to a high degree of confidence, that design errors have been eliminated. Some design assurance levels require that the objectives of the verification process be met with independence as addressed in Appendix A.

The software verification, software/hardware integration verification and systems integration verification processes are not addressed here. However, verification of hardware requirements during these processes is a valid method of hardware verification.

Changes to a verified configuration may be re-verified by similarity, analysis, newly designed tests or by repeating a portion of the original verification.

Note 2: Informal testing outside the documented verification process is recommended. The procedures and results, however, are not necessarily maintained under configuration management control but are highly effective in the detection and elimination of design errors early in the design process. Verification credit can be taken for this testing only if it is formalized.

### Verification Process Objectives

The objectives of the verification process are:

1. Evidence is provided that the hardware implementation meets the requirements.

2. Traceability is established between hardware requirements, the implementation, and the verification procedures and results.

3. Acceptance test criteria are identified, can be implemented and are consistent with the hardware design assurance levels of the hardware functions.

4. Omissions and errors are fed back to the appropriate processes for resolution.

### Verification Process Activities

Verification process objectives may be satisfied through a combination of methods, such as reviews, analyses, and the development and execution of tests. The verification plan documents the verification activities that should be employed to demonstrate compliance to the requirements.

Verification activities include:

1. Requirements that need a verification activity should be identified. It is not intended that requirements should be verified at every hierarchical level; requirements can be verified at a higher hierarchical level.

2. Verification methods, such as tests, simulation, prototyping, analyses and reviews, should be selected and performed.

3. Traceability between requirements, implementation, and the verification procedure and results should be established. Traceability should be consistent with the design assurance level of the function performed by the hardware. It is not intended to require traceability to detailed components, such as resistors, capacitors or gates, unless required for safety considerations.

4. Verification coverage analysis should be performed to determine that the verification process is complete, including:

   1. Each requirement has been verified at some hierarchical level by review, analysis or test.

   2. The review, analysis or test of each requirement is appropriate for verifying the requirement, especially with respect to safety requirements.

   3. The review, analysis or test results associated with the verification of each requirement are correct and that discrepancies between actual and expected results are explained. When expected results are not pre-defined as may be the case for reviews and analyses, the results of the verification activity should be consistent with the requirement, especially with respect to safety requirements.

5. The results of the verification activities should be documented.

6. Omissions and errors should be fed back to the appropriate process for resolution.
